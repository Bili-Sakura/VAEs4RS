% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2~inch (3~picas) on both left and
right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of 11~points.
The word \textsc{Abstract} must be centered, in small caps, and in point size 12. Two
line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to one
paragraph.
\end{abstract}

\section{Submission of conference papers to ICLR 2026}

ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by
\url{https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4RS2025}. See the ML4RS website \url{https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025/} for more instructions.

If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement {\tt
  {\textbackslash}iclrfinalcopy} should be inserted to adjust the
format to the camera ready requirements.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to the ML4RS workshop at ICLR 2025 must be prepared according to the instructions presented here.

%% Please note that we have introduced automatic line number generation
%% into the style file for \LaTeXe. This is to help reviewers
%% refer to specific lines of the paper when they make their comments. Please do
%% NOT refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will be removed from the
%% style file for the final version of accepted papers.

Authors are required to use this ML4RS ICLR \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the workshop website. Please make sure you use the current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

\subsection{Paper Length}

The maximum length for submission is 4 pages excluding references. You may add additional information into the supplementary appendix section after the references.

Please make sure that the submitted paper is anonymized!
